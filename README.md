# tantalus
Tantalus is a mass machine controller system / Remote Access Trojan built in Python &amp; C

I've prewritten malware agents/connectors in the following languages:
  - python
  - golang
  - c
*the malware victim/connector files will only be released when the project is complete (i've just started it)*
